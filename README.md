Please look at the following repo if you a looking for ready ubuntu desktop ansible receipe:
https://github.com/Benoth/ansible-ubuntu.git

I forked the repo above and modified it to meet my temporary needs.
My repo doesn't work well and most likely not well configured.

I have to use Windows now and rarely use Ubuntu as desktop
